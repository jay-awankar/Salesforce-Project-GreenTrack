# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

## 1. Requirement Gathering
- Communities, NGOs, and educational institutions often conduct eco-friendly activities (tree plantations, recycling, awareness drives).
- Currently, these activities are logged manually (spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, paper records).
- No systematic way to calculate the environmental impact (e.g., total CO₂ saved).
- Lack of recognition/gamification for participants reduces motivation.
- Need: A centralized Salesforce CRM system to track, calculate, and showcase sustainability efforts.

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis
- Participants (Students/Employees/Community Members): Log activities.
- NGOs / Environmental Clubs: Track progress of events and activities.
- Admins / Managers: Monitor dashboards, assign recognition, and showcase impact in reports.
- Society / Community: Indirect stakeholders who benefit from transparency and awareness.

## 3. Business Process Mapping
- Current Flow (Manual): Event Conducted → Participant fills Excel/WhatsApp → Data remains scattered → No accurate reporting.
- Proposed Flow (with Salesforce): Participant Logs Activity (Eco Activity object) → System Calculates CO₂ Saved (Flow/Trigger) → Auto Badge Assignment → Dashboards Updated (Leaderboards & Reports).

## 4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
- Environmental Sustainability: NGOs/CSR programs track green initiatives.
- Education Sector: Colleges track student eco-participation.
- Corporate CSR: Companies measure and report sustainability efforts.

## 5. AppExchange Exploration
- Explored Salesforce AppExchange for sustainability-focused apps (e.g., Sustainability Cloud).
- Decided to build GreenTrack as a custom app, since it is simpler, specific, and well-suited for this project’s scope.

## Summary:
- Clear Problem Statement & Use Cases defined.
- Identified stakeholders & workflows.
- Chosen custom Salesforce CRM solution over pre-built AppExchange apps for simplicity and scalability.
