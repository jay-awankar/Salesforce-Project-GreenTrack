## 🔎 <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
GreenTrack is a Salesforce CRM solution designed to track eco-friendly activities like tree plantations, recycling drives, and awareness events. It calculates environmental impact (e.g., CO₂ saved) and provides real-time dashboards for organizations to monitor sustainability initiatives.

It helps individuals, institutions, and organizations record sustainability activities, calculate their environmental impact, and visualize progress through dashboards.

### Industry:
- Environmental Sustainability / Non-Profit

### Project Type:
B2C & B2B Salesforce CRM implementation
- B2C (if individual students/employees log activities).
- B2B (if institutions, NGOs, or companies use it to track collective impact).

### Target Users:
- Community Members / Students / Employees → Log eco activities.
- NGOs / Environmental Clubs → Track initiatives.
- Management / Admins → View dashboards, analyse impact, assign recognition.
